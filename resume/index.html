                                May 2021-Present
                                <p>Leading a cross discipline team of software engineers and site reliability engineers
                                    focused on building, enhancing, and running identity services at scale. My main
                                    focus is to bring the tools and practices of professional software engineering to
                                    the
                                    Identity and Access Management engineering team at Microsoft while creating an
                                    environment where all identities used in the company are secure. Using techniques
                                    such as test driven development, infrastructure as code, continuous
                                    releases, and the efforts it takes to build on those my team is able to quickly make
                                    changes to any software service when needed and deploy
                                    them with confidence while maintaining an extremely high level of availability and
                                    trust.

                                <h6>Software Engineer / Architect (Identity and Access Management)</h6>
                                January 2020-May 2021
                                <p>Architected software solutions for identity and access management problems at
                                    Microsoft to fill the gaps of Azure Active Directory / on premises Active Directory
                                    to fulfill the principles of zero trust, least priviledged access, and proper
                                    identity hygiene at scale. Acted as an agent of change within the IAM organization
                                    by effectively influencing without authority. I enabled the maturation of the user
                                    provisioning, entitlement management, user licensing, and identity governance
                                    services to increase reliability, improve engineering teams velocity, reduce the
                                    number of LiveSite events, and increase employee retention. This work enabled
                                    multiple teams to meet their objectives
                                    quicker using professional software engineering techniques which has improved the
                                    security stance of Microsoft and made our identities more resistant to attack.
                                </p>
                                <p>In addition to architecting and building mature identity based software solutions, I
                                    also hired and built out a team of software engineers to solve identity problems at
                                    scale. Using this team, we were able to solve long-standing problems with
                                    legacy services to improve their reliability and also reduce the risk of exposed
                                    identity objects such as single factor authentication service accounts.</p>

                                <h6>Software Engineering Team Lead (Core Functions Engineering)</h6>
                                December 2017-January 2020
                                <p>Led a cross functional team of software engineers and service engineers to
                                    rearchitect, modernize, and implement digital transformation principles on the
                                    services used to support Microsoft's treasury and cash management functions.
                                    Significantly reduced operational risk by converting services to commonly accepted
                                    technologies, reduced operational cost and effort by moving all services to use
                                    Azure PaaS services, and increased team productivity / morale through implementation
                                    of practies such as agile, test driven development, and continuous deployment.
                                </p>
                                <p>With $30 billion moving through the cash management services each month, I also
                                    increased the security stance of both internally built services and vendor tools
                                    such as SWIFT so they are more resistant to malicious actors and exceeded both
                                    Microsoft and industry requirements. As a result of this work, these services were
                                    unable to be 'owned' by the internal Microsoft Red Team after repeated penetration
                                    tests.
                                </p>

                                <h6>Software Engineer (Azure Security Services)</h6>
                                December 2016-December 2017
                                <p>Collaborated with a small team of engineers to build,
                                    enhance, and maintain identity management and public key infrastructure (PKI)
                                    services so the identities used to manage the Azure backbone were secure and
                                    followed principles such as least priviledge, just in time access, and identity
                                    isolation.
                                    As a part of this effort, I also architected and built a certificate registration
                                    authority (OneCert) that is used to secure not only Azure's internal service
                                    communications and identities, but also many other essential services within
                                    Microsoft. This service has continued to grow after I left the team and has been
                                    able to handle the immense load using my initial design and implementation.
                                </p>
                                <p>Facilitated the maturation
                                    of the service team by implementing DevOps principles such as fully
                                    automated
                                    continuous integration /
                                    continuous delivery processes, systems integration tests that run at release time
                                    and continually to measure service health, and set a high bar for software
                                    engineering standards on the team. These efforts increased team velocity,
                                    improved service uptime and reliability, and democratized the full engineering
                                    process from idea to release so every engineer was effective and highly productive
                                    from day 1.

                                <h6>Software Engineering Manager </h6>
                                September 2013-December 2016
                                <p>Managed multiple software engineering teams and directed Parametric's holistic
                                    software services architecture so the company could continue its rapid growth and
                                    effectively enter new markets and product categories with minimal changes needed in
                                    its existing services. To enable this growth I was a key member of the IT leadership
                                    team focused on hiring new engineers, mentoring new and experienced engineers so
                                    they were able to reach their full potential, facilitated the continued maturation
                                    of Parametric's engineering practices with a focus on rapid continuous delivery, and
                                    partnered with leadership to drive Parametric's enterprise systems architecture.
                                </p>
                                <p>In addition to leadership and architecture responsiblities, led a small team of
                                    select engineers focused on improving performance, scalability, and reliability
                                    of Parametric's portfolio management and trading systems to support the company's
                                    continued growth. Using a data driven and iterative approach identified service
                                    bottlenecks and improved performance so that processes that took minutes or hours
                                    were able to reliably complete in seconds or less. This work was done across the
                                    entire stack from improvements made to client applications all the way back
                                    to improving the underlying network configuration and virtual machine
                                    infrastructure with the outcome of effectively using existing resources to keep
                                    costs flat and prevent major architectural changes while exponentially increasing
                                    load.

                                <p>Led a team of 5 software engineers and QA professionals to enhance and maintain
                                    the company's portfolio management and trading services so they could scale
                                    effectively and improve reliability given the company's rapid 25x growth. This work
                                    enabled many teams in the company to significantly reduce the amount of headcount

                                    using professional software engineering practices resulting in fast responses

                                <p>Collaborated with two other senior engineers to build and maintain the bank's
                                    counterparty risk management service ("CRMS"). This application was crucial to
                                    the broker arm of the bank where it measured the bank's risk to all external trading
                                    partners and enabled the bank's risk managers and trading team to mitigate the
                                    exposure to any single counterparty. Usage of this tool protected the bank from
                                    the failure of Bear Stearns and other broker failures during the 2007/2008
                                    financial crisis.
